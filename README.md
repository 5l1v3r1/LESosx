# LESosx
This is the repository for the LESosx source code

LES on mac is a modified version of the Hammerspoon client, which includes a bunch of custom scripts in it that self-extract.
If you go inside the .app package contents, you'll already see all of the code and resources available to you.
When I work on LES I just edit the files inside of the app package contents.

This git is for looking around and potentially adding changes to the LES portion of the program; I won't be cloneing hammerspoon here; but if people do something cool I'll definitely include it in the main package.

I'm not sure if this is the best approach for this, so let me know if you want me to set this up differently.
